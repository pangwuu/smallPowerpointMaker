Firm Foundation (He Won’t)
CCLI license number: 78517771
[Chorus]
Christ is my firm foundation
The Rock on which I stand
When everything around me is shaking
I've never been more glad
That I put my faith in Jesus
'Cause He's never let me down
He's faithful through generations
So why would He fail now?
He won't
He won't
[Verse]
I've still got joy in chaos
I've got peace that makes no sense
So I won't be going under
I'm not held by my own strength
'Cause I build my life on Jesus
He's never let me down
He's faithful in еvery season
So why would He fail now?
[Refrain]
Hе won't
He won't
He won't fail
He won't fail
He won't
No, no, no, no
He won't
He won't fail
He won't fail
[Chorus]
Christ is my firm foundation
The Rock on which I stand
When everything around me is shaking
I've never been more glad
That I put my faith in Jesus
'Cause He's never let me down
He's faithful through generations
So why would He fail now?
He won't
He won't
He won't fail
He won't fail, no, no
[Bridge]
Ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh
Rain came and wind blew
But my house was built on You
I'm safe with You
I'm gonna make it through
Rain came and wind blew
But my house was built on You
I'm safe with You
I'm gonna make it through
Oh, rain came and wind blew
But my house was built on You
And I'm safe with You
I'm gonna make it through
Yeah, I'm gonna make it through
'Cause I'm standing strong on You
Yeah, I'm gonna make it through
'Cause my house is built on You
[Chorus]
Christ is my firm foundation
The Rock on which I stand
When everything around me is shaking
I've never been more glad
That I put my faith in Jesus
'Cause He's never let me down
He's faithful through generations
So why would He fail now?
He won't (Hey)
He won't
He won't fail
He won't fail
[Outro]
He won't
He won't
He won't fail
He won't fail
No, He won't
