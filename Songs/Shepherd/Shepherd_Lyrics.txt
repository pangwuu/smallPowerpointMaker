[Verse 1]
Though I walk through the valley and I can't see the way
When the shadows surround me, I will not be afraid
For I know You are with me, You will always provide
Though the path may be lonely, You will stay by my side
I will rest my soul, I'll trust in You alone
[Chorus]
For the Lord, my Shepherd
Leads me, leads me
And He is all I need
In the darkest valley
I know, I know
My Shepherd is all I need
[Verse 2]
Lord, I know that You seek me when I'm trying to hide
And Your love it pursues me all the days of my life
I will rest my soul, I'll trust in You alone
[Chorus]
For the Lord, my Shepherd
Leads me, leads me
And He is all I need
In the darkest valley
I know, I know
My Shepherd is all I need
[Bridge]
I rest my soul, in You alone
You light my way, You lead me on
I rest my soul, in You alone
You light my way, You lead me on
[Chorus]
For the Lord, my Shepherd
Leads me, leads me
And He is all I need
In the darkest valley
I know, I know
My Shepherd is all I need
