Nothing but the Blood of Jesus
Public domain
[Verse 1]
What can wash away my sin?
Nothing but the blood of Jesus
What can make me whole again?
Nothing but the blood of Jesus
[Verse 2]
For my pardon this I see
Nothing but the blood of Jesus
For my cleansing this my plea
Nothing but the blood of Jesus
[Chorus]
Oh, precious is the flow
That makes me white as snow
No other fount I know
Nothing but the blood of Jesus
[Verse 3]
This is all my hope and peace
Nothing but the blood of Jesus
This is all my righteousness
Nothing but the blood of Jesus
[Chorus]
Oh, precious is the flow
That makes me white as snow
No other fount I know
Nothing but the blood of Jesus
[Verse 4]
Glory glory this I see
Nothing but the blood of Jesus
All my praise for this I bring
Nothing but the blood of Jesus
[Chorus]
Oh, precious is the flow
That makes me white as snow
No other fount I know
Nothing but the blood of Jesus (x2)
