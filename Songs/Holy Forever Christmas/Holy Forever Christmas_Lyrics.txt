Holy Forever (Christmas)
CCLI license number: 74531089
[Verse 1: Chris Tomlin]
Held within a manger
The Son of God arrived
The One who would be called Emmanuel
The promise was delivered
Unto a virgin bride
The One who would be called Emmanuel
[Pre-Chorus: Chris Tomlin]
Your name is the highest
Your name is the greatest
Your name stands above them all
All thrones and dominions
All powers and positions
Your name stands above them all
[Chorus: Chris Tomlin & Choir]
And the angels cry, "Holy"
All Creation cries, "Holy"
You are lifted high, holy
Holy forever
[Verse 2: Chris Tomlin, Jenn Johnson & Choir]
In the humble town of David
A Savior born today
The One who would be called Emmanuel
Behold the host of Heaven
With holy roar, proclaim
The One who would be called Emmanuel
The Messiah, our God, is with us now
[Chorus: Chris Tomlin, Jenn Johnson & Choir]
And the angels cry, "Holy"
All Creation cries, "Holy"
You are lifted high, holy
Holy forever
Hear Your people sing, "Holy"
To the King of kings, holy
You will always be holy
Holy forever
[Pre-Chorus: Chris Tomlin, Choir & Jenn Johnson, Jenn Johnson]
Your name is the highest
Your name is the greatest
Your name stands above them all
All thrones and dominion
All powers and positions
Your name stands above them all, Jesus
Your name is the highest
Your name is the greatest
Your name stands above them all
All thrones and dominions
All powers and positions
Your name stands above them all
[Chorus: Chris Tomlin, Jenn Johnson & Choir, Jenn Johnson]
And the angels cry, "Holy"
All Creation cries, "Holy"
You are lifted high, holy
Holy forever
Hear Your people sing, "Holy"
To the King of kings, holy
You will always be holy
Holy forever
[Outro: Chris Tomlin]
You will always be holy
Holy forever
