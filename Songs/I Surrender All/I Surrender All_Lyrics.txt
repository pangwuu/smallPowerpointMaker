[Verse]
All to Jesus I surrender
All to him I freely give;
I will ever love and trust him
In his presence daily live
I surrender all
I surrender all
All to thee, my blessed Savior
I surrender all
All to Jesus I surrender;
Make me, Savior, wholly thine;
Let me feel the Holy Spirit
Truly know that thou art mine
I surrender all
I surrender all
All to thee, my blessed Savior
I surrender all
All to Jesus I surrender;
Now I feel the sacred flame
Oh, the joy of full salvation!
Glory, glory, to his name!
I surrender all
Oh, I surrender all
All to thee, my blessed Savior
I surrender all

Oh, I surrender all
Oh, I surrender
