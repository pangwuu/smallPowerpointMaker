[Chorus]
He is Lord! He is Lord!
He is risen from the dead and He is Lord!
Ev'ry knee shall bow, ev'ry tongue confess
that Jesus Christ is Lord.
He is Lord! He is Lord!
He is risen from the dead and He is Lord!
Ev'ry knee shall bow, ev'ry tongue confess
that Jesus Christ is Lord.
He is Lord! He is Lord!
He is risen from the dead and He is Lord!
Ev'ry knee shall bow, ev'ry tongue confess
that Jesus Christ is Lord.
