[Verse]
All the saints and angels, they bow before Your throne
All the elders cast their crowns before the Lamb of God and sing
[Chorus]
You are worthy of it all
You are worthy of it all, Jesus


For from You are all things
And to You are all things
You deserve the glory
[Verse]
All the saints and angels, they bow before Your throne

For from You are all things

You deserve the glory!
You are worthy of it all
You are worthy of it all
For from You are all things
And to You are all things
You deserve the glory!
