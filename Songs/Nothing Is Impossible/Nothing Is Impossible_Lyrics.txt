[Chorus]
Through You, I can do anything
I can do all things
For it's You who gives me strength
Nothing is impossible
Through You, blind eyes are opened
Strongholds are broken
I am living by faith
Nothing is impossible
[Interlude]
Yeah
Nothing is impossible
Oh-ooh
[Verse]
I'm not gonna live by what I see
I'm not gonna live by what I feel
[Pre-Chorus]
Deep down I, know that You're here with me (Here with me)
And I know that You can do anything
[Chorus]
Through You, I can do anything
I can do all things
For it's You who gives me strength
Nothing is impossible
Through You, blind eyes are opened
Strongholds are broken
I am living by faith
Nothing is impossible
[Interlude]
Woah-ooh
Nothing is impossible
Woah-ooh
[Verse: Israel Houghton]
I'm not gonna live by what I see
No, I'm not gonna live by what I feel
[Pre-Chorus]
Hey, deep down I, know that You're here with me (Here with me)
And I know that You can do anything
[Chorus]
Through You, I can do anything
I can do all things
For it's You who gives me strength
Nothing is impossible
Through You, blind eyes are opened
Strongholds are broken
I am living by faith
Nothing is impossible
[Interlude]
Woah-ooh
Nothing is impossible
[Bridge]
I believe, I believe
I believe, I believe in You
I believe, I believe
I believe, I believe in You
I believe, I believe
I believe, I believe in You
I believe, I believe
I believe, I believe in You
[Chorus]
Through You, I can do anything
I can do all things
For it's You who gives me strength
Nothing is impossible
Through You, blind eyes are opened
Strongholds are broken
I am living by faith
Nothing is impossible
