Turn Your Eyes Upon Jesus
CCLI license number: 84376058
[Chorus]
Turn your eyes upon Jesus
Look full in His wonderful face
And the things of earth will grow strangely dim
In the light of His glory and grace
[Verse 1]
O soul are you weary and troubled?
No light in the darkness you see?
There's light for a look at the Savior
And life more abundant and free
[Verse 2]
Through death into life everlasting
He passed and we follow Him there
Over us, sin no more hath dominion
For more than conquerors we are
[Chorus]
Turn your eyes upon Jesus
Look full in His wonderful face
And the things of earth will grow strangely dim
In the light of His glory and grace
[Verse 3]
His word shall not fail you, He promised
Believe Him and all will be well
Then go to a world that is dying
His perfect salvation to tell
[Chorus]
Turn your eyes upon Jesus
Look full in His wonderful face
And the things of earth will grow strangely dim
In the light of His glory and grace
