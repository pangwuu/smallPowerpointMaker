[Verse 1]
I can sing with my whole heart, I have all I need
In Jesus, my Saviour, my joy is complete
Onward to glory yet here I will wait
I will trust in Christ every step I take
[Verse 2]
I am sure of Your promise to guide me each day
Though some may oppose me, I won't be ashamed
Whatever I face, Lord, it won't be in vain
I will trust in Christ every step I take
[Chorus]
For all of my days, I will live for Your glory
Running with courage and faith
The prize of my journey, the joy of salvation
To meet my King face to face
[Verse 3]
So I'm looking to Jesus, perfector of faith
My heart set on heaven where treasure awaits
I'll run with endurance to finish the race
I will trust in Christ every step I take
[Chorus]
For all of my days, I will live for Your glory
Running with courage and faith
The prize of my journey, the joy of salvation
To meet my King face to face
[Bridge]
I will, I will rejoice
Whatever comes my way
God You're faithful to save
[Bridge]
I will, I will rejoice
I know that God is with me always
[Bridge]
I will, I will rejoice
Whatever comes my way
God You're faithful to save
[Bridge]
I will, I will rejoice
I know that God is with me always
[Bridge]
I will, I will rejoice
Whatever comes my way
God You're faithful to save
[Bridge]
I will, I will rejoice
I know that God is with me always
[Chorus]
For all of my days, I will live for Your glory
Running with courage and faith
The prize of my journey, the joy of salvation
To meet my King face to face
