[Verse 1]
Though the nations rage, kingdoms rise and fall
There is still one King reigning over all
So I will not fear for this truth remains
That my God is, the Ancient of Days
[Chorus]
None above Him, none before Him
All of time in His hands
For His throne it shall remain and ever stand
[Chorus]
All the power, all the glory
I will trust in His name
For my God is, the Ancient of Days
[Verse 2]
Though the dread of night overwhelms my soul
He is here with me, I am not alone
O His love is sure, and He knows my name
For my God is, the Ancient of Days
[Chorus]
None above Him, none before Him
All of time in His hands
For His throne it shall remain and ever stand
[Chorus]
All the power, all the glory
I will trust in His name
For my God is, the Ancient of Days
[Bridge]
Though I may not see what the future brings
I will watch and wait for the Saviour King
Then my joy complete standing face to face
In the presence of the Ancient of Days
[Chorus]
None above Him, none before Him
All of time in His hands
For His throne it shall remain and ever stand
[Chorus]
All the power, all the glory
